` Class: CSC2710
 ` Description: This program takes a list of weighted edges and finds the edges 
 ` that connect all the devices (verticies) in the graph for the least cost using Kruskals algorithm.
 `
 ` to compile: g++ ConnectionCost.cpp -o CC.
 ` (make sure MinHeap.h, MinHeap.cpp, DisjointSets.h, and DisjointSets.cpp are in the same directory)
 ` 
 ` to execute the program using I/O redirection where output goes to
 ` standard output: CC <test.txt
 `
 ` if you want the output to go somewhere else, execute 
 ` this way: CC < test.txt > output.txt
